====================================================================================================

CoreBase is the core module of LIGHTFORCE DB. XObject is a class that handles data persistently 
as both a C++ object and a JSON object. XObjectManager serves as an object factory that creates
and manages instances of the XObject class.

In other words, CoreBase is an essential module in the LIGHTFORCE DB system, which manages databases.
XObject is a flexible class that can handle data for efficient storage,
retrieval and management. XObjectManager helps to create instances of the XObject class,
so that developers can easily manipulate and work with their data objects.
To summarize, CoreBase, XObject, and XObjectManager play different but important roles
as part of the overall LIGHTFORCE DB system, specifically in the area of data storage and management.
